# 名词

## 名词分类

**1. 专有名词**

定义：人名、地名、团体名、机构名等专有名称。

注意：专有名词中实词的第一个字母大写。

```
Bejing;
Tom;
the People's Republic of China;
```

**2. 普通名词**

**3. 可数名词**

**4. 不可数名词**



## 复数

1. 普通单词直接+s;

2. s、o、x、sh、ch结尾的词+es

   ```
   class => classes;
   box => boxes;
   hero => heroes;
   dish => dishes;
   bench => benches;
   ```

3. 大部分o加s，部分加es

   ```
   potato
   tomato
   hero
   motto
   volcano
   ```

4. 以辅音字母加y结尾的名词，变y为i，加es

   ```
   family => families
   ```

5. 以y或fe结尾的名词，变f或fe为v，再加es

   ```
   shelf => shelves;
   wolf => wolves;
   ```

6. 不规则变化

   ```
   man => men;
   woman => women;

   ```



## 名词所有格

名词词尾加's

以s或es结尾的复数，直接加 '

```
teachers => teachers'
```

表示时间、距离以及世界、国家、城镇等名词，词尾加's

```
ten minutes' break 十分钟的课间休息
```

名词一般可用介词of短语表示所有关系

```
a fine daughter of the Party 党的好女儿
```

's还可以表示某人的家或某店铺

```
my aunt's 我阿姨家
the doctor's 诊所
```

当两人共有某物时，可以采用A and B's的形式

```
Lucy and Lily's bedroom
如果Lucy后也有's，那表示二人各自都有一间屋子
```

双重所有格：“of+名词所有格/名字性物主代词”

```
a friend of my father's 我父亲的一位朋友
a friend of mine 我的一位朋友
```



## 主谓一致

主语是可数名词单数或不可数名词，谓语动词用单数。

```
The computer was a great invention.
```

集体名词做主语，如果突出整体概念，谓语用单数，突出其中的某个人，就用复数

```
Class Three is a very good class.
Class Three have a map of China.
```

单复同形，如：fish、sheep、people

```
There is a sheep in the yard. 院子里有只羊。
There are some sheep in the yard. 院子里有一些羊。
```

有s结尾的单词，谓语用单数

```
The news is very exciting.
```

以复数形式出现的单词：glasses，shoes，socks

```
The trousers are very cheap and I want to take them.
```

a lot of :跟名词复数时，用复数，否则单数

```
A lot of students are playing baseball now.
A lot of time was wasted on that work.
```

and：连接两个名词做主语时，用复数；两个名词构成一个整体事物时，谓语用单数

```
The teacher and his son are picking apples now.
Fish and chips is very famous food.
```

就近原则：there be句型；either...or或neither...nor

```
There is a table and four chairs in the room.
Either you or he is right.
Neither you nor I am going there.
```

主语中有with的短语时，谓语单复数由with之前的人物决定

```
A woman with a 7-year-old child was standing at the side of the road.
```

表示一段时间或长度概念的复数名词做主语时，谓语用单数

```
Two months is not a short time.
```

主语中含有half of等词语时，谓语的单复数由名词确定

```
Over three quarters of the information on the internet is in English.
A third of the students were playing near the lake
```
